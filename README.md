* ISBN-10 ‏ : ‎ 0134210220
* * ISBN-13 ‏ : ‎ 978-0134210223
  * * Author: Richard D. De Veaux; Paul F. Velleman; David E. Bock
   
  * Encourages statistical thinking using technology, innovative methods, and a sense of humor
 
Inspired by the 2016 GAISE Report revision, Intro Stats, 5th Edition by De Veaux/Velleman/Bock uses innovative strategies to help students think critically about data – while maintaining the book’s core concepts, coverage, and most importantly, readability.

By using technology and simulations to demonstrate variability at critical points throughout the course, the authors make it easier for students to understand more complicated statistical later in the course (such as the Central Limit Theorem). In addition, students get more exposure to large data sets and multivariate thinking, which better prepares them to be critical consumers of statistics in the 21st century.

The 5th Edition’s approach to teaching intro stats is revolutionary, while retaining its lively tone and popular features such as Think/Show/Tell examples.
